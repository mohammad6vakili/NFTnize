## Getting Started

<div faq="How can I get started with using the marketplace?">

#### Set up a wallet

Users will be required to have a wallet set up that communicates with the Algorand blockchain - compatible wallets include: My Algo Wallet, Algorand Wallet and Algo Signer.

#### Ensure that it contains minimum funds

Our platform offers three major transactional services: buying, minting, and selling. Each one requires a minimum fee to be in a user's wallet.

- Selling: Users will have to have a minimum of 1 ALGO in their wallet to list an item for sale.
- Minting: There is no minting cost other than Algorand’s transaction fee of 0.001 ALGO.
- Buying: The asking price of a buyer or the reserve fee of an auction.

#### Connect the wallet to the platform

Once the wallet is set up users may connect to the platform by signing in at the top right corner. They may log out any time and change wallets at their leisure.

<div faq="Where can I learn more about Algorand’s NFT ecosystem?">

</div>

## Cultivating your collection

### Buying

<div faq="How can I buy an NFT?">

All buyers will be required to hold ALGO in a compatible wallet. Once done explore, please explore!

ALGO can be acquired through an exchange and then transferred to one of the following wallets: My Algo Wallet, Algorand Wallet or Algo Signer.

</div>

<div faq="What happens once I purchase an NFT?">

If the buyer purchases an NFT for a specified amount of ALGO, they will be prompted to opt into the NFT’s asset ID so they can receive it. Once the transaction is signed, the NFT will transfer to the wallet that is connected.

</div>

<div faq="I was the highest bidder in an auction but did not win. Why is this?">

All auction listers have the right to indicate a reserve price. This means that if the reserve price has not been met by the highest bidder, the auctioned NFT is not required to be sold to them.

</div>

<div faq="How can I learn more about the NFT I intend to buy?">

Whilst in an active listing, users can click on the arrow pointing to the image of the NFT. The page that proceeeds contains useful information such as: the creator, embedded royalties and the quantity in circulation.

</div>

<div faq="I have been outbid, but my bid has not returned to my wallet. Why does this occur?">

Rest assured, bids are refunded to a user’s wallet balance as soon as a higher bid is placed. However, these refunded amounts are not displayed in a wallet’s transactions.

Note: This is due to RandLabs' AlgoExplorer. They do not show 'inner transactions', which is what the plaform's contracts use.

</div>

<div faq="I have purchased an NFT using the ‘Buy Now Function’ and it does not show in my wallet’s transaction history. What should I do?">

All purchased NFTs will transfer immediately to the buyer. Buyers can be assured of this by searching for the purchased asset’s ID in AlgoExplorer - https://algoexplorer.io/ . Here, they may check under the ‘Holders’ tab to find that they own the purchased asset.

Note: The transfer of assets may not be displayed on a wallet’s transactions because of the current iteration of RandLabs' AlgoExplorer. They do not show "inner transactions", which is what the platform’s contracts use.

</div>

### Selling

<div faq="How can I sell an NFT?">

The seller must ensure that the NFT they wish to sell is in the wallet connected to the platform and navigate to - [https://markets.nftnize.io/sell](https://markets.nftnize.io/sell).

The seller confirms which method of sale they prefer - 'Auction' or 'Fixed Price'. Once confirmed, they select their NFT from the drop down list and fill out the corresponding sale details.

Finally, they may click 'Sell NFT' and sign the associated transactions the platform prompts.

</div>

<div faq="What happens once I list an item for sale?">

The seller signs a contract that transfers their NFT to a secure platform wallet. There it will stay until an auction ends, it is purchased or the seller closes the Buy Now application.

</div>

<div faq="Can I edit my auction details?">

No. Once the smart contracts and auction details have been finalized, the asset is sent to a platform wallet for the duration of the listing.

</div>

<div faq="What should I do if I no longer want my NFT to be sold or listed?">

If you no longer want your NFT to be listed, you may go to the active listing and click ‘Close Buy Now’.

</div>

<div faq="The auction period has finished with no bidders, how may I retrieve my NFT?">

The seller receives their NFT back by clicking ‘Close Auction’ on the auction page.

</div>

### Minting

<div faq="How can I mint an NFT?">

Navigate to - [https://markets.nftnize.io/nftnize](https://markets.nftnize.io/nftnize). Before all else, users must ensure their creation is:

- less than 40 MB
- Of format: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, MP4, WEBM, MP3, WAV, GLB, and GLTF.

First, users provide a name - if ever listed, this will be its title. Then provide a unit name - if ever transferred this will identify the NFT.

The user updates the remaining information to their needs.

Once completed they can click ‘Mint’, this will mint the NFT and prompt a transaction that ensures that their newly minted NFT transfers to their wallet.

</div>

<div faq="Can I mint more than one NFT?">

Yes. Creators have the freedom to decide the quantity in the minting process.

</div>

<div faq="Which ARC Standard should l use?">

It depends on the project. For those unaware, the ARC3 uses official metadata format whilst ARC69 uses a format created by the Algorand community.

</div>

## Royalty and Fee breakdown

<div faq="Can creators control the royalties they receive?">

Yes. In the minting process artists can decide what percentage of the selling price they receive each time an NFT of theirs successfully sells.

</div>

<div faq="What fees should I consider when using the platform?">

All users should be ready to pay the Algorand fees associated with all the transactions included in the minting, selling and buying process.

Sellers should be aware that to create a listing, they must pay a negligible listing fee of 0.658 ALGO. If sellers successfully sell an NFT, they receive their sale price and a percentage of their listing fee back whilst paying a 2.5% fee to the platform.

</div>

## Miscellaneous Troubleshooting

<div faq="Whilst listing for a sale I have received the message ‘Application has failed to create’?">

Firstly, double check the recent listings of the 'Buy' secrtion - https://markets.nftnize.io/buy?type=buy - as the listing may have processed.

Ensure pop-ups are allowed in your browser (can be enabled in the top right of your screen), so all the suitable transactions can be signed.

</div>

<div faq="While listing, I have tried to search for an NFT by name  yet the site returns ‘No assets found!’. What can I do?">
  
Users must wait till the platform indexer has loaded their assets before attempting to search for specific NFTs by name.
