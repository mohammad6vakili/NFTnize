Yieldly is the operator of this website (&quot;website&quot;) app, platform and related services made available under the Yieldly name including the marketplace available on the platform (together, the &quot;Platform&quot;).

In these Terms, the User means (as applicable) a person using any part of the Platform in any capacity, including a person using the Platform as a buyer, seller or an person browsing the Platform.

We do not provide any investment, financial, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar professional advice on the Platform. Blockchain, cryptocurrency, tokens, trading Non-Fungible Tokens and related transactions involve a high degree of risk and there is always the possibility of loss, including the loss of digital currency, NFTs and assets. Yieldly is not responsible for any costs, taxes, losses or damages a User incurs as a result of or in connection with buying, selling and trading NFTs on this Platform.

Users acknowledge that buying, selling and trading NFTs is significantly risky and is unregulated by any central or government authority. Users warrant that they understand the risks associated with access to or use of this Platform and any goods, services or products offered or made available or used in connection with this Platform.

## Use of Platform

For the purpose of these Terms, &quot;NFT&quot; means Non-Fungible Tokens and/or related digital creations and/or digital assets (including all materials associated with those Non-Fungible Tokens and/or related digital creations and/or digital assets).

The Platform may provide the ability for Users to sell NFTs (&quot;Seller&quot;) and Users to buy NFTs (&quot;Buyer&quot;). Users may be able to buy, sell, mint, auction and/or search for NFTs implemented on the Algorand blockchain using smart contracts.

A User&#39;s use of this Platform is subject to these Terms. These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between the User and Yieldly, and a User&#39;s use of the Platform constitutes their acceptance and acknowledgement of the Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any other policy displayed on the Platform, all of which constitutes the Terms.

A User does not need to connect their MyAlgo, Algorand Wallet or AlgoSigner Wallet ( **&quot;** Blockchain Wallet&quot;) to the Platform to be bound by the Terms; any simple use, such as browsing NFTs or opening any part of the Platform, will constitute acceptance of these Terms. If you do not agree to the Terms, you must not use the Platform.

Yieldly may amend or modify the Platform, the Terms and/or the Privacy Policy at our sole discretion and at any time. Yieldly will make available any material updates to the Terms on this website.

A User may only access and use this Platform if you are at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract. By using the Platform and/or accepting any services made available on this Platform, you warrant that you are at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract.

These Terms will prevail over any other terms or agreement between a User and Yieldly, including any other terms proposed by a User.

Users acknowledge and agree that Yieldly is not a party to any agreement entered into between different Users and Yieldly does not have control over the conduct of Users of the Platform, including and in relation to the procurement or sale of illegally acquired NFTs on the Platform.

## Registration

Users will need to connect their Blockchain Wallet to the Platform (&quot;Registration&quot;) to buy, sell, trade and/or mint NFTs on the Platform.

## Listings and Fees

Upon Registration, a User can list a NFT for sale or auction (&quot;Listing&quot;) on the Platform.

When a Seller is creating a Listing, the Seller has discretion as to sale price or the starting auction price of the NFT. Yieldly does not make any representations as to the value of the Listing and has no control over the price set by a User.

The Seller will incur the following fees payable to Yieldly in relation to the sale of NFTs on the Platform:

- a listing creation fee for listing an NFT for sale â€“ this fee fluctuates based on the number of blockchain operations performed, and the size of the smart contract code to be executed; and
- 2.5% of the total sale price of the NFT as a platform fee upon the successful purchase of the NFT,

(together, the &quot;Service Fees&quot;).

The Service Fees may be amended at the sole and absolute discretion of Yieldly at any time. Yieldly will advise of any amendments to the Service Fees by posting the amended Services Fees on the website.

Yieldly has the right at its discretion to deduct the Service Fees direct from the sale proceeds paid or payable by a Buyer for a Listing before the sale proceeds are transferred to or made available to the Seller. All Service Fees paid to or deducted by Yieldly are non-refundable except at the sole discretion of Yieldly.

## Transfer of Ownership

Ownership of the NFT will remain with the Seller until the Buyer has paid the purchase price of the NFT in full. From the time the Buyer commits to a purchase of a Listing, the Seller must not do anything which seeks to create an encumbrance, lien, charge, or other security interest over the NFT.

Ownership of the NFT will be transferred from the Seller to the Buyer when the Buyer has paid the purchase price of the NFT in full and otherwise on the terms specified by the Seller, including terms as to the intellectual property rights (and any limitations on those rights) which may be transferred to the Buyer.

Transfer of ownership to the Buyer is effected when it appears in a Buyer&#39;s Blockchain Wallet. After a sale has occurred, the Seller will no longer be able to withdraw the NFT from their Blockchain Wallet.

By using the Platform, each Seller agrees that:

- they have the full and unqualified right and entitlement to sell the NFT described in the Listing and the right to transfer ownership of the NFT, free of encumbrances and third party interests, to the Buyer upon completion of the sale;
- they own the intellectual property rights associated with the NFT described in a Listing, or they have all rights necessary to use the intellectual property rights associated with any NFT included in a Listing, including the right to sell the NFT to third parties;
- they will not engage in any illegal activity, including the sale of stolen, fraudulent or counterfeit NFTs; and
- Yieldly may at any time and for any reason remove a Listing from the Platform at its sole discretion.

All transactions involving the purchase and sale of a Listing are final.

## Payment

_Applicable to Buyers_

- Buyers agree to pay the relevant purchase price for the Listing to the Seller.
- Buyers must pay the purchase price using Algorand Coin (ALGO).
- Buyers agree to ensure that their Blockchain Wallet contains sufficient funds before attempting to bid on or purchase a Listing.
- Buyers agree to use funds that are legitimately obtained and will not attempt to pay for a Listing through fraudulent or unlawful means.

_Applicable to Sellers_

- Upon payment of the purchase price of a Listing, the Seller acknowledges that Yieldly will deduct the Service Fee before the net sales proceeds are transferred to the Seller&#39;s Blockchain Wallet.
- Sellers appoint Yieldly as limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the purchase price from the Buyer.
- Once the Seller receives payment from the Buyer, the Seller requirement to pay the Seller for the sale and purchase of the Listing will be satisfied. The Buyer&#39;s obligation to the Seller will be deemed to be completed.
- Sellers acknowledge that Yieldly may refuse to process a payment if we believe that the funds are illegitimate, fraudulent, or being used for unlawful means (eg, money laundering).

**NFT Intellectual Property Rights**

By using the Platform, including by creating, submitting, listing, posting, promoting or displaying content including NFTs and related materials, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, and display all such content, including but not limited to text, materials, images, files, communications, comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas, concepts, questions, data, or otherwise, that you list, submit or post on or through the Platform for our current and future business purposes, including to operate, provide, promote, and improve the Platform. This includes any digital file, art, or other material linked to or associated with any NFTs that are displayed on the Platform.

For clarity, listing or posting User content on the Platform (including NFTs and related materials) does not transfer ownership to Yieldly or any rights to Yieldly other than on the terms of the licence specified above.

You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licences, consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein for any content that you create, submit, list, post, promote, or display on or through the Platform, including NFTs and related materials.

The transfer of intellectual property rights to a Buyer under a transaction is determined by the terms of sale stipulated by the Seller in a smart contract. Yieldly does not control the terms of smart contract between a Buyer and Seller in relation to a sale of a Listing. Buyers must ensure that they review and determine whether the licence granted under a smart contract in relation to a sale of a Listing is fit for their purpose and the Buyer accepts all risks associated with the intellectual property in a Listing purchased on the Platform.
